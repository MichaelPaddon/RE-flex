Description: The regex-centric, fast lexical analyzer generator for C++.
 RE/flex is the regex-centric, fast lexical analyzer generator with full
 Unicode support, indent/nodent/dedent anchors, lazy quantifiers, word
 boundaries, and many other modern features. RE/flex also includes a fast
 regex engine written in C++ with options to generate finite state machine
 tables or direct code to match input more efficiently. RE/flex includes a
 smart input class to normalize input from files, streams, strings, and
 memory. RE/flex is compatible with Bison/Yacc and accepts Flex lexer
 specifications.
